Games without graphical interface

1. TicTacToe -> A simple TicTacToe game made in OOP in Python, the basic idea was that the player can easily play, so it is not needed to chose the MARK in the game again and again, it took me some time but I think it is better than play the game by choosing the mark over and over.First it was made only with funcitons and then with classes to get more exp. in OOP.It is not a big project I know but I enjoyed it and if you would like to play with it then here you go :).
2. PaperRockScissor -> Simple game made in a few row of code, not a big deal but it was a good one to learn how to play against the computer and use loop.
3. StoryGame -> A game build based on a Tree data structure, the player has to chose the path he\her wants to ''walk'', I did not write a long story at this one, I kept it short.
if you want to try it here you go :).
4. Survalien -> My first game with graphical interface. I made it with pygame and other helper module. This game is about to survive the meteor falls in the space you as an alien.
You can control the alien with the KEY ARROWS and it has a speed ability too, press SPACE to activate. Feel free to play around with it.
5. TowerOfHanoi -> This one is made of a STACK STRUCTURE and some USER input and FUNCTIONS as well. Play with it if you want to.
